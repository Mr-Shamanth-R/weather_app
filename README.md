# Weather App

A simple and intuitive weather application that provides real-time weather information for current location. The app displays the place name, sky condition, maximum temperature, hourly forecast (horizontally scrollable), and daily forecast (vertically scrollable).

## Features

- **Place Name**: Displays the name of the location for which the weather is being shown.
- **Sky Condition**: Shows the current sky condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- **Maximum Temperature**: Displays the maximum temperature for the day.
- **Hourly Forecast**: A horizontally scrollable list of weather conditions for each hour.
- **Daily Forecast**: A vertically scrollable list of weather conditions for the upcoming days.
